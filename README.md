## Requirement 3 Ideasd
Some thoughts about what to do for requirement 3 of the lab.

- Custom Control, toolbar item, representing the current BestFile.
    - Or adjacent to this a toolbar item which extends a combo-box and shows the resource files that are linked to the current bestfile.
- Custom User Control, Markdown Editor Pane
    - Nested toolbar controls
    - Rich text editor
    - Event for editing the text in the rich text editor.

**Will Implement these in winforms for the purpose of the lab and then again in MAUI**
